### AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate
In my Co-op work terms as a full-stack developer, I would **leverage** cloud solutions in application development, but I never fostered **ownership** over them. I span up **Azure VMs** multiple times for school projects, but I was always just doing what I would do locally in the cloud - build the code, deploy it to a web server over HTTPS, etc.. - all **manually**, never **cloud-natively**.

I needed to know the **language** and **offerings** of the cloud **beyond just implementing what I already know**.

The **AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate** certification bridges this knowledge gap. So I **earned** it.

It **enabled** me to supplement my full-stack development with modern cloud computing principles, which I leveraged in a contract role where I migrated a small business' legacy IT system to Azure, as the principles presented in the course are **cloud-agnostic**.

I followed Tom Carpenter's extensive prep-course, sourced below, and implemented what I learned in various projects you can find on my [GitHub](https://github.com/justinklein2001).
