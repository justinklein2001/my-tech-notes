### Cloud Computing Defined

### Benefits of Cloud Computing
- Increased **resiliency**, **performance** and **capacity**.
  
### Cloud Computing Models
1. **Full Cloud Deployment**: **Nothing** exists on premises.
2. **Hybrid Development**: Both **on-prem** and **in-cloud**.
3. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Platforms/applications run on other infrastructure that you must manage (**VMs**).
4. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: You don't manage the infrastructure, applications are deployed on platforms (**Docker**).
5. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Someone else develops the software, you use it from the cloud (**Email**).

### AWS Foundational Services
1. **Compute**
2. **Storage**
3. **Database**
4. **Network**
