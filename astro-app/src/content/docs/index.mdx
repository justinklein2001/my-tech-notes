## What makes this site cool?

<CardGrid stagger>
	<p>
	Anyone can write a bunch of notes on tech. But this site links all docs to real-world, production grade code on GitHub.
	</p>
	<p> All these notes were first hand-written before being added here. These concepts
	are presented as how I understand and apply them in real-world scenarios. It also acts as the source of a vector database
	for a RAG LLM study agent you can check out <a>here</a>.</p>
