### What is this site?
<Card title="It's technical notes in my own words." variant="info" class="mb-6">
  A novel concept, right? The goal is to have a site I can refer back to when I need a refresher on a topic.
</Card>
<Card title="It's a step on the path towards mastery." variant="info" class="mb-6">
  I learn best when I watch an expert explain a topic, translate it into my own words, and then build something leveraging that knowledge. This site is the second step in that process.
</Card>
<Card title="It's the knowledge base for a RAG study agent." variant="info" class="mb-6">
   Sometimes I forget things. By having my notes in a structured format, I can build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) study agent that can help me review and retain information more effectively.
