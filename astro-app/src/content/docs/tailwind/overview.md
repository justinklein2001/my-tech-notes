description: Overview on why I chose to learn tailwindCSS.

In my professional experience, I've leveraged multiple component-based frontend/CSS frameworks (such as **MaterialUI** and **Bootstrap**). While extremely convenient, they can bloat the final size of the production build. I wanted something leaner, especially when it comes to getting responsive, **mobile-first** layouts up and running quickly. tailwindCSS was the ideal framework to learn next.
